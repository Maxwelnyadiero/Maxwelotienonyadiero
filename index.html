    <h2>About me</h2>
    My name is Nyadiero Maxwel,I am Akenyan citizen by birth,i do courageously say that, i do come from Homa-bay county,
      i did join Pundo kalanya from Nursery upto class eight where by i did manage to get 280marks in my last exams that is K.C.P.E,after that i joined sero mixed secondary school,and sat for my K.C.S.E,during my school life it wasnt that good in that most of the time i could stay at home due to lack of school fee,but to my pleasure i did manage to finish high school.
      It haven't been that much easier for me to seek employement in any sector,but at one point i did join the field of jua-kali sector that is mjengo immidietly i come to Nairobi,but when i was at home i did venture in farming which helped me to earn aliving.

      <p>The main reason why i did have intrest in programming was,The world today is computerised hence most of the employers do employ those who atleast are computer litrete.
        on top of that this is afield which by most of the people do not venture at due to inability of funds,that is the course is that much expensive for other the local people.</p>
        <p>My intrest as aperson is that at one point i should be agreat progmmer,so that i can accomplish my goals.
          i do love football very much,and of all games football is what can take alot of my time</p>
